"breathin"
By Yaisnet De La Cruz

Just keep breathin’ and breathin’ and breathin’
“breathin”
Ariana Grande 
People suffering from anxiety.
Thousands of sounds can be heard.

*thump thump*
The heartbeat is louder than ever before.
The walls begin spinning around me.
I look up and the whole room's spinning
“breathin” starts playing
I remember I am not alone.
Just keep breathing.

Ariana
not only trying to get money
trying to bring light.
Misunderstood
like no one knows what we are going through.

Some days things just take way too much of my energy
Ariana sings
“Breathin”
I feel a sense of calm.
Ariana
knowledge of how it feels 
into her music.

Music
liked by many,
Money
but not just entertainment.
Her music is as soothing 
as the sound of waves hitting sand.
